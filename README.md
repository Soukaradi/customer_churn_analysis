# ðŸ“Š StreamVerse Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

This project dives into the critical business challenge of **customer churn** for a fictional streaming service, "StreamVerse." It's a data-driven journey to understand *why* customers leave and to develop actionable strategies to keep them engaged and subscribed.

## Why I Built This Project

I undertook this project to demonstrate a complete data analytics workflow, from raw data to business solutions. It allowed me to:

* **Generate Realistic Data**: I created a synthetic dataset from scratch, intentionally building in realistic customer behaviors and churn patterns. This showcased my ability to work with and manipulate data when real-world data isn't available.
* **Design & Query Databases**: I designed a relational database schema in PostgreSQL and used **SQL** to extract, transform, and analyze key metrics. This highlights my foundational database skills.
* **Uncover Insights**: Through detailed analysis, I identified the main drivers of churn, such as plan type, content engagement, and customer support experience.
* **Propose Solutions**: Most importantly, I translated these data insights into concrete, actionable business recommendations for StreamVerse to improve customer retention.

This project showcases my ability to not just analyze data, but to turn it into a compelling story that drives real-world business value.

## Lessons Learned

This project was an incredible learning experience, solidifying my understanding of the entire data analytics lifecycle. I gained hands-on expertise in:

* **Data Simulation**: Building complex, interconnected datasets with intentional biases.
* **Advanced SQL**: Using queries to extract insights and track key metrics.
* **Connecting Data to Strategy**: Translating analytical findings into clear, actionable business recommendations.
* **Problem-Solving**: Iteratively refining analysis and constantly asking "why" to uncover root causes.

My primary goal for this project was to master SQL querying and the reporting of insights, demonstrating how these skills can drive effective business solutions.
